            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>If I am critical of these efforts, you have a right to expect that I communicate an alternative. And here it is.</h1><p>Back and forth the ball goes over the net. One player hits the ping pong ball, the other player returns it. Sometimes it leaves the table top as the result of a bad shot, only to be returned back to the table to start over. The game is confined to a distinct space, and the ball really never moves in any direction at all, other than a repetitive back and forth…eventually the game becomes tiresome and the players move on to something more interesting. The game remains unchanged…it’s still ping pong.</p></article>]]></description>
